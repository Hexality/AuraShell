The plan is base it on [this figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1210604678477457621/chrome-os) and recreate the main UI/UX of ChromeOS (Ash/AuraShell) using Quickshell.
Keep in mind that this project will aim to be WINDOW MANAGER AGNOSTIC, so it will NEVER implement X WM-exclusive features.
